# ESP32 & 4x4 Button Matrix
This project is to play around with the uses of some cheap chinese 4x4 button matrix, an ESP32 DevkitV1 and SSD1306 OLED. I am using the Arduino IDE for this project which makes programming these uC very easy.

## Libraries
- Adafruit GFX
- Adafruit SSD1306
- [Keypad](https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad)
